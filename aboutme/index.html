    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <img alt="image of me?"src="images/mafer_pic.jpeg">
    <h2>Maria Fernanda del Rosario Carrillo Colina</h2>
    <h2>Fun fact:In my family some people called me Fer, others Fernanda, but in High School my friends used to call me Mafer. Now, that I live in Mexico, here people call me sometimes MaryFer</h2>
    
    <p>Sometimes is hard to define ourselves in a couple of lines, but I will try.</p> 

    <p>I am a VenezuelanÂ´s mother & wife who happened to discover a wonderful calling in life that prompted me to help people in distress by practicing law for the last 22 years of my life. Even though, I did not know I will be in that path, it felt so right when I discovered I was really helpful to others.</p> 

    <p>I have always been curious; I love exploring and discovering new things. As a child always played pretending to discover ancient civilizations or even new planets, that is why I enjoyed my time as a girl scout during my teen years. I do not know why I love to ask so many questions, it is important to me to imagine processes in my mind.</p> 

    <p>I have enjoyed to be part of the Generation X because I tasted the best of two worlds, before and after we got the internet. I like to build structures or even fixing simple things around the house. </p>

    <p>I love my family very much, they are my shield, my heart, my everything. I love God and justice. I really want to become a better version of me. I have suffered hardships, I have overcome so many of them and I am still fighting with the Lord by my side and my family, I know we will be able to overcome still the storms we have around, I am confident that the Lord will guide us during this time of probation.</p>
    
    <p>Technology is something that I want to understand from within and I want to know if I would be able to help others, as well by using these tools for the benefit of humanity.</p>
